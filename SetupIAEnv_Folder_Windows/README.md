# SetupIAEnv_Folder_Windows

This project aims to install all packages required to perform machine learning and artificial intelligence on Windows.

To do this, go in the folder you want to put the project, and clone the project (for instance in \MachineLearningProject).

Then install Anaconda3.

Then, in Anaconda, go to the environment tab, click on base (root), then Open Terminal.
Then with the terminal, go to the SetupIAEnv project that you have cloned (for instance: `cd \MachineLearningProject\SetupIAEnv`).

Go to the folder \SetupIAEnv\SetupIAEnv_Folder_Windows with the following command in the terminal: `cd \SetupIAEnv\SetupIAEnv_Folder_Windows`.

Finally, execute the .bat you want (with or without gpu support) in the terminal: `SetupIAEnv_gpu.bat` or `SetupIAEnv_gpu.bat`.

The script will create the env iaenv in Anaconda3 with all the packages useful for the machine learning and artificial intelligence.
